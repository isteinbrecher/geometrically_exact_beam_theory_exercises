# Computer lab for **Nichtlineare Strukturmechanik**

The exercises in this repository are part of the course _Nichtlineare Strukturmechanik_ at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Christoph Meier.

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that contain the exercises.
The notebooks can be run interactively in your browser using this link [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/isteinbrecher/nonlinear_structures_exercise/main).

Some general instructions for using the notebooks in the interactive browser session:
- The first time you open a notebook via the Binder link, it may take a few minutes to start up.
- You can run the code cells in the notebooks by selecting a cell and pressing `Shift + Enter`.
- If you want to save your changes, you need to download the notebook to your local machine (`File > Download`).
- The interactive environment provided by Binder is temporary and will be reset after a period of inactivity, so make sure to save your work regularly.
